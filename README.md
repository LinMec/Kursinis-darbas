# Fraud detection system (with Signal and Graph visualization and its applications)


## Introduction

A Python program to detect and trace financial fraud by analyzing data patterns. Visualizes findings via signal (wavelet/FFT) and graph-based models.

## Description

This program is designed to detect and trace financial fraud by analyzing data patterns. It visualizes its findings either via signal (where wavelet and FFT is used, and is compared to the threshold), or through graph-based models that illustrate relationships using vertices and edges.
